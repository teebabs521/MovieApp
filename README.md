# Note

If you want to run it locally, then follow these steps.

## Steps :

1. Open your terminal and run `git clone git@github.com:teebabs521/MovieApp.git`
2. Once the cloning is completed, open this cloned folder in IDE(Vscode).
3. Create the `.env.local` file in the root directory as you need to provide the TMDB api in order to fetch the movie datas.
4. Inside the `.env.local` file create the variable `REACT_APP_TMDB_KEY=_________________` (Add your own TMDB Api key from [TMDB Website](https://www.themoviedb.org/) by creating an account.)
5. Once all the above steps are done, open your terminal once again and run `npm install` to install the required modules and finally run `npm start` to see the site live.
